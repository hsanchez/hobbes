    #  - 'FirstClassFunction.java'

  - description: "A class inherits from its direct superclass and any direct superinterfaces all the accessible methods of the superclass and superinterfaces, with one exception: if a name is declared as a method in the new class, then no method with the same signature is inherited. Instead, the newly declared method is said to override any such method declaration."

  - description: "An overriding method must not conflict with the definition that it overrides, for instance, by having a different return type."

  - description: "Overridden methods of the superclass can be accessed using a method invocation expression involving the `super` keyword."
