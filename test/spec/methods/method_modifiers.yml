  - description: "A class method may refer to other fields and methods of the class by simple name only if they are class methods and class (`static`) variables."

  - description: "A method can be declared `final` to prevent subclasses from overriding or hiding it."

  - description: "A `private` method and all methods declared in a `final` class are implicitly `final`, because it is impossible to override them."
